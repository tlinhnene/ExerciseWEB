    <p style="color:#060;" align= "justify" >Sales in the Southern region were off last year as the economy entered a slight
        downturn. Sales of the M100-10 model suffered the largest declineâ€”15% under two
        years ago. The lone bright spot was the continuing strong sales of the M300-25.</p>
